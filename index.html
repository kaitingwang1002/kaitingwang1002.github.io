2001, Born
In the evening of October 2nd, Tuesday, August 16th in the lunar calendar, a baby boy was born in Beijing.

2008, Age 7
In September, he entered Gonghua Central Primary School (巩华中心小学) in Changping District, Beijing. He achieved outstanding academic results. During this time, he received calligraphy training and participated in a choir group, winning many awards at both district and municipal levels in Beijing. He was also very interested in electronic products.

2014, Age 13
He began attending Wenhui Middle School (文汇中学) in Dongcheng District, Beijing for junior high school, and lived in the school dormitory. His academic performance remained excellent. His homeroom teacher was Mrs. CHEN Jian; influenced by her, he started reading works by Japanese writer Haruki Murakami. He also developed an interest in Korean music, self-taught Korean language, and learned classical guitar.

2017, Age 16
He was admitted to Beijing No.5 High School for senior high school studies. He once rented an apartment in Anwai Garden Community, Block III of Hepingli, Dongcheng District. Academically, his performance was above average. His homeroom teacher was Mr. YANG Zheng. During this period, he joined the Model United Nations club, attended over ten conferences, and met many excellent students across Beijing. He also participated in publicity work for the student union. Musically, he became fond of the band Sodagreen.

2020, Age 19
At the beginning of the year, he created a WeChat public account named "Reminiscent Yesterdays", where he published some personal records and original content. He was admitted to China University of Petroleum-Beijing for undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, achieving above-average academic results. He lived in Building 3 of Runjie Apartment. One year later, he transferred into the major of Machine Design, Manufacturing and Automation, where his academic performance ranked mid-level within the program. His academic advisor was Mr. WANG Wenjie. He served as a class cultural-sports committee member and publicity committee member, and joined the university art troupe’s choir. Shortly after entering university, he met Miss LIU Boyuan, and during the following four years, they traveled together across China. He also became interested in stock trading. In gaming, he enjoyed playing Overwatch and Genshin Impact.

2024, Age 23
Under the guidance of Special Associate Professor WANG Tun, his undergraduate thesis titled "Research and Design of Water-Cooling System for Directly Driven Top-Drive Main Bearing" won an award. During summer vacation, he read "Killing Commendatore" and was deeply impressed. Later that year, he enrolled in the mechanical engineering program at City University of Hong Kong. This marked his first trip abroad. During his studies, he lived in Kingland Apartment in Mong Kok. His research focused on the application of MXene materials in supercapacitors, under the supervision of Professor ZHANG Kaili and Pakistani scholar HUSSAIN Iftikhar.
